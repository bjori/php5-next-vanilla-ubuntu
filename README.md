Debian PHP packaging
====================

This repo is a fork of the official debian PHP packaging repository.

The intentions of this fork is to remove the weird debian patches, and be as
up2date with the official PHP5.3 releases as possible.

This repos is furthermore used as the packaging recipe for the launchpad ppa,
which provides PHP5.3 binary packages for various Ubuntu versions.

Ubuntu users will therefore be able to run the latest vanilla PHP version
without any hassle at all.
