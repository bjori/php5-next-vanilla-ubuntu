Debian PHP packaging
====================

This repo is a fork of the php5-vanilla-ubuntu github repo (which then again is
a fork of the official debian PHP packaging repository).

The intentions of this fork is to provide packaging information for PHP trunk/
to build ubuntu packages from.

This mean you can have fun experimenting with PHP.next (PHP5.4) without any
hassle, allowing you to ensure future compatibility of your applications with
PHP.
